# Cloudinary Integration Guide for AFEX

## Overview
AFEX now uses Cloudinary for storing and serving user profile pictures, cover photos, and other media files. This provides better performance, automatic optimization, and reliable CDN delivery.

## What's Been Updated

### 1. Backend Changes
- **Avatar Uploads**: User profile pictures are now uploaded to Cloudinary
- **Cover Photos**: User cover photos are now uploaded to Cloudinary
- **Shorts/Posts**: Video and image content is uploaded to Cloudinary
- **Automatic Optimization**: Cloudinary automatically optimizes images and videos

### 2. Frontend Changes
- **Avatar Display**: Updated to handle Cloudinary URLs properly
- **Optimized Loading**: Images are served with Cloudinary transformations
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallback for legacy uploads

## How It Works

### Avatar Upload Process
1. User selects a profile picture
2. File is uploaded to backend as base64
3. Backend uploads to Cloudinary with folder structure: `afex/avatars/`
4. Cloudinary returns optimized URL
5. URL is stored in user's profile
6. Frontend displays optimized image

### URL Structure
- **Avatars**: `https://res.cloudinary.com/[cloud-name]/image/upload/afex/avatars/avatar_[user-id]_[timestamp]`
- **Covers**: `https://res.cloudinary.com/[cloud-name]/image/upload/afex/covers/cover_[user-id]_[timestamp]`
- **Shorts**: `https://res.cloudinary.com/[cloud-name]/video/upload/afex/shorts/short_[timestamp]_[random]`

### Frontend Avatar Utility Functions

```javascript
// Get optimized avatar URL with transformations
getOptimizedAvatarUrl(avatar, size = 150)

// Check if avatar is from Cloudinary
isCloudinaryAvatar(avatar)

// Get basic avatar URL
getAvatarUrl(avatar)
```
