# Understanding and Fixing `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` Error

## What This Error Means

The `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` error occurs when your browser tries to load a resource (image, script, CSS, etc.) from a URL that cannot be resolved to an IP address. This typically happens when:

1. **Malformed URLs** - URLs that don't follow proper format
2. **Non-existent domains** - Trying to access domains that don't exist
3. **Missing resources** - References to files that don't exist on your server
4. **DNS issues** - Network connectivity problems

## The Issue We Found

In your case, the error was caused by references to `/default-avatar.png` in the `NewChatModal.js` file. This file doesn't exist in your public directory, so the browser couldn't resolve the URL.

## What We Fixed

✅ **Updated `frontend/src/components/chat/NewChatModal.js`**:
- Changed `src={user.avatar || '/default-avatar.png'}` 
- To `src={user.avatar || 'https://via.placeholder.com/48x48/6b7280/ffffff?text=U'}`

This ensures that when a user doesn't have an avatar, it falls back to a placeholder image service instead of trying to load a non-existent local file.

## How to Debug Similar Issues

### 1. Use the Browser's Developer Tools

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the **Network** tab
3. Look for failed requests (red entries)
4. Check the **Console** tab for error messages

### 2. Use the Debug Script

Run this in your browser console to identify problematic URLs:

```javascript
// Check all image tags for malformed URLs
const images = document.querySelectorAll('img');
images.forEach((img, index) => {
  const src = img.src;
  console.log(`Image ${index + 1}:`, {
    src: src,
    isValid: isValidUrl(src),
    element: img
  });
});

function isValidUrl(string) {
  try {
    new URL(string);
    return true;
  } catch (_) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 3. Common Causes and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Missing avatar images | `/default-avatar.png` doesn't exist | Use placeholder service: `https://via.placeholder.com/...` |
| Broken image links | Incorrect file paths | Check file exists in public directory |
| Malformed URLs | Invalid URL format | Validate URL structure |
| CORS issues | Cross-origin restrictions | Add proper CORS headers |

### 4. Best Practices

✅ **Always provide fallbacks for images**:
```javascript
// Good
src={user.avatar || 'https://via.placeholder.com/48x48/6b7280/ffffff?text=U'}

// Bad
src={user.avatar || '/default-avatar.png'}
```

✅ **Use onError handlers**:
```javascript
<img 
  src={user.avatar} 
  onError={e => { e.target.src = 'https://via.placeholder.com/48x48/6b7280/ffffff?text=U'; }}
/>
```

✅ **Validate URLs before using them**:
```javascript
function isValidUrl(string) {
  try {
    new URL(string);
    return true;
  } catch (_) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the updated frontend** to Netlify
2. **Open the chat page** in your browser
3. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
4. **Check the Network tab** - you should no longer see `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors
5. **Test the New Chat modal** - it should load without errors

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always use external placeholder services** for fallback images
2. **Test your app** with users who don't have avatars
3. **Use proper error handling** for image loading
4. **Regularly check browser console** for errors during development

## Socket.IO Connection Status

Your Socket.IO connection is working correctly:
- ✅ Connected with ID: `aPRAXemdF-OzXlEtAABn`
- ✅ User joined successfully: `6869514bf2b57945ad800243`
- ✅ Messages are being sent and received

The `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors were unrelated to Socket.IO functionality.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the frontend changes** to Netlify
2. **Test the chat functionality** - it should work without errors
3. **Monitor the browser console** for any remaining issues
4. **Report back** if you see any other errors
