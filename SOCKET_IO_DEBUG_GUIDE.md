# Socket.IO Debugging Guide

## 🔍 **Issue Identified: "Transport unknown" Error**

The Socket.IO connection is failing with a "Transport unknown" error, which indicates a configuration issue with the Socket.IO server.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Enhanced Socket.IO Server Configuration**
Updated `backend/server.js` with proper Socket.IO settings:

```javascript
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    credentials: true,
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
  },
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
  allowEIO3: true,
  pingTimeout: 60000,
  pingInterval: 25000
});
```

### **2. Improved Error Handling**
- Added better connection logging
- Enhanced disconnect handling
- Added transport information logging

### **3. Enhanced Health Check**
Updated `/api/health` endpoint to include Socket.IO status:

```javascript
app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    status: 'OK', 
    message: 'AFEX API is running',
    socket: {
      onlineUsers: onlineUsers.size,
      transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
    }
  });
});
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend Changes**
1. Commit and push your backend changes to your repository
2. Trigger a manual deploy on Render
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### **Step 2: Test the Fix**
Run the test script to verify the fix:

```bash
node test-socket-fixed.js
```

### **Step 3: Test in Browser**
1. Open your frontend in the browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Navigate to the chat page
5. Look for these logs:
   ```
   🔍 Setting up Socket.IO connection to: https://afoxlys.onrender.com
   ✅ Socket.IO connected with ID: [socket-id]
   🔍 Current user ID: [user-id]
   🔍 Emitted join event for user: [user-id]
   ```

## 🔧 **If Issues Persist:**

### **Check Render Logs:**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your backend service
3. Check the logs for:
   - Socket.IO connection messages
   - Any error messages
   - Transport information

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **Issue 1: Still Getting "Transport unknown"**
**Solution:**
- Check if the backend has been redeployed
- Verify the Socket.IO configuration is correct
- Check if there are any environment variable issues

#### **Issue 2: CORS Errors**
**Solution:**
- The CORS configuration has been updated
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify the frontend URL is allowed

#### **Issue 3: Connection Timeout**
**Solution:**
- Check if the backend is running
- Verify the URL is correct
- Check network connectivity

### **Browser-Specific Issues:**

#### **Chrome/Firefox:**
- Check if WebSocket is enabled
- Disable browser extensions that might block WebSocket
- Clear browser cache and cookies

#### **Safari:**
- Safari has stricter WebSocket policies
- Try using polling transport only

#### **Mobile Browsers:**
- Some mobile browsers have WebSocket limitations
- The polling fallback should handle this

## 🧪 **Testing Scripts:**

### **1. Basic Connection Test:**
```bash
node simple-socket-test.js
```

### **2. Enhanced Test:**
```bash
node test-socket-fixed.js
```

### **3. Backend Health Test:**
```bash
node test-backend-health.js
```

## 📊 **Expected Results:**

### **✅ Working Correctly:**
- Socket connects immediately
- No "Transport unknown" errors
- Messages are sent and received in real-time
- Connection status shows as connected

### **❌ Still Not Working:**
- Connection timeout
- "Transport unknown" errors persist
- CORS errors in browser console
- Messages not being received

## 🔍 **Debugging Checklist:**

- [ ] Backend has been redeployed with new Socket.IO config
- [ ] No "Transport unknown" errors in tests
- [ ] Browser console shows successful connection
- [ ] Connection status indicator disappears
- [ ] Messages are sent and received
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console

## 🆘 **Getting Help:**

If the issue persists after implementing these fixes:

1. **Check Render logs** for any backend errors
2. **Test with the provided scripts** to isolate the issue
3. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
4. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
5. **Test with different browsers** to rule out browser-specific issues

---

**The main issue was the Socket.IO server configuration. The fixes should resolve the "Transport unknown" error and enable real-time messaging.**
